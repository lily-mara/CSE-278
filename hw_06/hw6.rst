1. Moore's Law estimates that chips will be able to pack twice as many
   transistors every year.

	1. Power requirements decrease as processing power increases
	2. Since memory and the ALU are closer together on denser chips, the
	   electrical path is shortened, increasing operating speed.
	3. Similarly powered computers become smaller.
	4. The cost of similarly powered computers falls dramatically.

2. If the processor with the lower clock speed has a lower CPI than the
   processor with the higher clock speed, it will end up with a faster
   execution time.

3. CPI: :math:`1.55` MIPS: :math:`2.58 \times 10^{13}` Execution
   Time: :math:`3.88 \times 10^{-3}` seconds

4. Benchmarks:

	- Machine 1:

		- CPI: :math:`2.2222`
		- MIPS: :math:`9 \times 10^{13}`
		- Execution time: :math:`0.2` seconds

	- Machine 2:

		- CPI: :math:`1.9167`
		- MIPS: :math:`1.04 \times 10^{14}`
		- Execution time: :math:`0.23` seconds

5. Speedup

	a. CPI: :math:`2.64`
	b. MIPS: :math:`151.5`
	c. Speedup factor: :math:`6.17`
	d. Theoretical speedup :math:`\frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{8} \left( 1 - 1 \right)}`

1. Clock speeds

   a. Time per cycle :math:`T\left(5\textit{GHz}\right) = \frac{1}{5,000,000,000} \textit{ seconds}`
   b. Time for 3 cycles :math:`T\left(3\textit{ cycles}\right) = \frac{3}{5,000,000,000} \textit{ seconds}`

2. :math:`T\left(b\right) = \frac{15b + 10}{10,000,000,000} \textit{ seconds}`

   :math:`T\left(64\right) = \frac{970}{10,000,000,000} \textit{ seconds}`

   :math:`T\left(64\right) = \frac{97}{1,000,000,000} \textit{ seconds}`

3. :math:`\frac{2}{11}` cycles are wasted for 2 byte instructions

   :math:`\frac{4}{13}` cycles are wasted for 8 byte queue

4. Pipeline speedup

   a. The pipelined processor has a :math:`5\times` speedup over the non-pipelined processor
   b. The pipelined processor has a throughput of 12,500 MIPS

5. Pipeline speedup

   a. A typical program will get a 4x speedup
   b. The non-pipelined processor has a throughput of 625 MIPS, the pipelined
      processor has a throughput of 2,500 MIPS

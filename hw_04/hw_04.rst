#. The CS register points to the location of the code segment in memory. The DS
   register points to the data segment in memory. The SS register points to the
   location of the stack segment in memory. The ES register can be used to point

#. Addressing modes:

    #. Base addressing
    #. Displacement addressing
    #. Displacement addressing
    #. Displacement addressing

#. This instruction would be located at :code:`2100H`.
